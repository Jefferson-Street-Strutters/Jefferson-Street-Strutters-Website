## Les Elkins Trumpet 

Les is originally from West Virginia, growing up in Chuck Yeager's hometown. He played trumpet in high school marching bands and continued playing while he attended the West Virginia Institute of Technology in Montgomery, WV. There he also sang with the Guy Owen Baker Chorale, traveling with them to Germany, Austria, Poland, and Hungary.

When Les moved to Maryland he was pleased to find many opportunities to continue playing, including the Columbia Community Band, Rockville Brass Band, and the employee's band at the Naval Surface Warfare Center at White Oak, MD. In addition to JSS Les currently plays trumpet with the New HOTS Jazz Orchestra and occasionally the Rockville Brass Band and other groups. He has also played in some fifty-odd pit bands for community theaters in the area. Les has also appeared on stage in a number of musicals and operettas, as part of the chorus or as an occasional role in community and professional theaters in DC and Maryland.

He is pleased to have this opportunity to find the trad jazz sound, work on his improvisation (only took twenty-five years of playing to get ready to learn to improvise!) and is pleased to have yet another venue to perform with his new wife, the vocalist.


## Steve Luchter, Clarinet & Sax

Steve is our clarinet player. His lifelong interest in traditional jazz started in his high school days. He says many of the songs we play now are the same ones he played back then. That wasn't the start of his musical career; he began to play violin at age six, and continued with that instrument until age 13, when he became enamored with the clarinet. Steve says his aspires to play like Willie Humphrey, the clarinetist with the Preservation Hall Jazz band in the 80s. He feels that no one puts more feeling into his music than Willie.

When Steve graduated from high school he had to decide between engineering and music as a career and chose engineering. That didn't mean he gave up on music. In his college days he played in a big band, and over the years played in a number of concert bands. He retired in 2001 and has devoted his principal energies to music since then. His first project was to take all of the music courses offered at the Northern Virginia Community College. To sharpen his improvising, he attended several sessions of the Adult Jazz Camp offered by the San Diego jazz society America's Favorite City Jazz Society. In 2002 he co-founded Jefferson Street Strutters. 

Although his primary interest is in traditional jazz, Steve also plays Russian folk music as a member of the *Washington Balalaika Society* orchestra where he plays the alto balalaika. He founded an ensemble from within that organization, Russkiye Musikanti, a group that plays at senior centers, schools, civic events and as the warm-up band in the lobby prior to the orchestra concerts. Steve plays percussion with that group. 

Another area of interest is as an advocate for the arts. Steve is president of the Arlington Citizens for the Arts and has appeared before the Arlington County Board and the School Board advocating for issues of interest to the arts community. 

Maybe genetic, but in any case, Steve has two sons involved in the music scene. His older son, Justin, is a bass guitar player and an expert in sound engineering. His younger son, Peter, is a drummer, presently leading a fusion jazz band.


## Dave Tucker, Pianist

## Ragtime, Stride & Early Jazz Piano

Dave Tucker lives in Alexandria, Virginia, is married (Cindy) with two children (Michael & Christina), and conducts patent research for a living. Dave has played piano, specializing in ragtime, since 1970. In the early 1990s he took up piano performance with great enthusiasm and began to expand his playing into other early jazz forms such at stride and novelty piano.

Dave is an internationally known performer of early jazz styles. His first CD “Tickled Ragtime & Novelties” in 2001 featured the music of Scott Joplin, Joseph Lamb, Zez Confrey and others. Recently, while expanding his ragtime repertoire, Dave has explored many other forms of early syncopated music including European novelty piano and the Harlem stride of James P. Johnson, Willie “The Lion” Smith and Fats Waller. His second CD “Meadow Lark”, issued in April 2005, reflects his intense research, study and numerous experiences since first becoming a regular performer on the ragtime circuit. Meadow Lark includes songs of many styles, such as classic and modern-era ragtime, Harlem stride and other examples of early jazz piano music. Dave is currently working on a project to record the entire Scott Joplin repertoire while also working on another CD of ragtime, stride and early jazz pieces. 

Dave has performed at the International Scott Joplin Ragtime Festival, the Blind Boone Ragtime Festival, the West Coast Ragtime Festival, the Lake Superior Ragtime Festival, the Eau Claire Ragtime Festival, the Alexandria Bay Ragtime/Jasstime Festival and the Northern Virginia Ragtime Society, among other numerous appearances. Dave has also conducted several ragtime presentations for school children.

Dave now performs regularly in the Washington D.C. region. In 2005, Dave joined the Hots Jazz Orchestra as their pianist, performing hundreds of tunes in numerous styles covering the time period of 1890-1945. In addition, Dave helped develop a new jazz trio/combo called Reverie (http://www.reveriejazz.com), now performing regularly. This group specializes in presenting early jazz standards in their original style. Dave joined the Jefferson Street Strutters in 2007. In December 2008 Dave became the Director of The Hot Society Orchestra of Washington, an 11- piece group performing music from the 1920s-1940s (http://hotsociety.net). Dave also works with other musicians and vocalists for various projects in the D.C. area, and maintains a website covering his activities at http://www.turboragtime.com.
