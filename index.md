The Jefferson Street Strutters play traditional jazz and American popular songs from the 1900’s through the early 1940’s.  Our approach is captured by our motto “We Play Happy Music”. Our goal is to create hand-clapping, toe-tapping joyful excitement at your important event.

The Strutters are based in Northern Virginia and provide entertainment throughout the entire Washington, DC region. The group is available for restaurants & clubs, corporate events, community gatherings, private parties, wedding receptions, political events, retirement communities, gospel services, retirement parties, and all sorts of special occasions. Besides the full Dixieland style band, the group also offers various small-combo configurations with repertoire to suit your needs.
